The purpose of this repo is to have a set of scripts with my own personal spin on packages that should be on a distro for a functional end-user desktop experience covering some basics.
You're welcome to copy and/or modify/improve my scripts. Please provide feedback on the modifications or improvement.
I will try to cover the more widely known distributions, but I tend to stray away from Gnome, so you will find scripts mostly for KDE and Cinammon desktop environments.
