The purpose of this repo is to have a set of scripts with my own personal spin on packages that should be on a distro for a functional end-user desktop experience covering some basics like Development, CD/DVD Burning software, Games (Open Source and Commercial), Video Encoding and Virtualization.

You're welcome to copy, modify and/or improve my scripts. Please provide feedback on the modifications or improvement.

I will try to cover the more widely known distributions, but I tend to stray away from Gnome, so you will find scripts mostly for KDE and Cinammon desktop environments.

The idea is to run this script once after completing the initial distribution setup and once completed reboot your system and have a fully functional desktop.

List of supported distributions so far:
